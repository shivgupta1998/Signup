# Sign-up Form

Sign-up is the first project from the [Intermediate HTML and CSS](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css) section of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). It is intended to give students an opportunity to dive deeper into design principles and more advanced CSS concepts such as advanced selectors, CSS functions and custom properties. Working demo [here](https://implexrr.github.io/sign-up/).

## Installation

To create a copy of the project, type the following command into your terminal:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:implexrr/sign-up.git
```

Note that the stylesheet and script link paths in this project will need to be changed in order for the CSS/JS files to render properly.

## Usage/Features
[Take a look here!](https://implexrr.github.io/sign-up/) Note that successfully completing the sign up will simply refresh the page, as the service doesn't actually exist. An incorrect submission will yield the appropriate error indicator.
